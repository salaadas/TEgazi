Tetris game for unix systems

This documentation will be extended when there is time and need for it.

Game idea:
	Pack the dropping blocks as tight as you can,
	rotating them if necessary and to keep the stacks
	as low as possible, as long as possible.
	
Problems:
	See FAQ.
	
Game name:
	See FAQ.

Sound modules (audio_*.c)
	Mostly from the EsounD archive, some (like
	audio_esd.c and audio_ossmidi.c) developed
	laterwards for this game.
	
Miscellaneous
	Use audiotest to test your audio hardware,
	iotest to test your display hardware.
	iotest has the same commandline usage as joeltris10.

Usage
	joeltris10 [dispdev [xres yres vxres vyres]]
	
	  dispdev can be either vt100, ggi or sdl.
	  Which one is default, is set on ./configure.
	  
	  xres, yres, vxres and vyres mean the
	  visible and virtual x- and y-resolutions.
	  They are effectful only with the ggi driver
	  and the SDL driver, skipped with vt100 driver.
	  default xres,yres, vxres,vyres
	  settings are: auto auto 640 384
	  
	  To set which device does libggi draw to,
	  read the libggi documentation.
	  Examples:
	      export GGI_DISPLAY=svga
	      export GGI_DISPLAY=palemu
	  X and fbdev are automatically detected.
	  fbdev may need specifying the resolution
	  values to not confuse your monitor.
	
Legal
	Joeltris 10 is under GPL (see COPYING).
	Now, should here stand something useless
	like "all trademarks are property of
	their respective owners"?
