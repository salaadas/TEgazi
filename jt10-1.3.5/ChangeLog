Wed 16.01.2008 06:12 Bisqwit <bisqwit@iki.fi>

	* Working with version 1.3.5
	
	* Added SDL support
	* Added screenshots to the web documentation.

Wed 01.05.2002 22:59 Bisqwit <bisqwit@iki.fi>

	* Working with version 1.3.3
	
	* Updated the urls in the archive.

Thu 11.04.2002 15:48 Bisqwit <bisqwit@iki.fi>

	* Working with version 1.3.2
	
	* Added some web documentation for the new pages.

	* Middle versions were undocumented.

Thu 28.10.1999 07:29 Bisqwit <bisqwit@iki.fi>

	* Working with version 1.01
	
	* Brainwashed all bots a bit.
	  They may now be better or worse.
	  
	* Moved bot definitions out to
	  a separate file, jt10.com.
	 
	* Found bug in gcc v2.95.1,
	  see LoadComputerFile().
	  
	* Started work with twin game
	
	* Added bot editor
	  - Does yet nothing else
	    than resets the game.
	    
	* Tested with tamagoch!
	  Ur, I mean with
	  HP-UX tamagoch B.11.00 A 9000/898
	  
	* Modified io_term.c
	  Now it uses termio.h functions,
	  not termios.h (however, they contain
	  the same functions... But it is
	  different now, anyway).
	
	* Todo:
	  - TCP/IP game (dual player)
	  - High scores (possibly shared in net).
	  - Evil blocks and cheat blocks in
	    the Joeltris 9 -style.
	  - Cooperative game (playing into same field)
	  - Make audio_esd.c working in all cases.
	  - Is it ever possible that somebody could
	    get score of over 999999? Check it out.
	  - Remove the field handling all out
	    from the tetris_t, create new
	    object type field_t, so that multiple
	    tetrises could refer to the same field.
	    First it would be useful in the main
	    intro screen, then in cooperative game.

	* Added some selectibility to the io drivers
	* Added dialog call to configuration script

Mon 24.10.1999 23:32  Bisqwit <bisqwit@iki.fi>

        * Going to put the game to the Internet!
        
        * Added Joeltris 1-6.
	* Added Joeltris 7-9
	
	* Todo:
	  - Evil blocks and cheat blocks.
	  - TCP/IP game (dual player)
	  - High scores.
	  - Make audio_esd.c working in all cases.

	  - Start video_ggi.c sometime.

Mon 7.6.1999 18:30  Bisqwit <bisqwit@iki.fi>
	
	* Started work with beta6
	
	* What a catastroph and bankrupt!
	  video_fb.c has become a symlink
	  to video_term.c even inside
	  jt10-beta5.tar.gz. I am waiting
	  for the backup from Warp, if even
	  he does have it...
	  
	* Drop-slide is now fixed.
	
	* Keybuffer thing is also fixed.
	  Key presses shouldn't now get lost.
	  
	* 8.7.1999:
	  The catastroph mentioned above
	  caused a month long pause in the
	  development of the game.
	  Backups from video_fb.c could not
	  be found ANYWHERE. Damn.
	  
	* The game is perhaps a bit slow.
	  Fiddle with the MAIN_RATE.	  
	
	* Todo:
	  - Evil blocks and cheat blocks.
	  - TCP/IP game (dual player)
	  - High scores.
	  - Make audio_esd.c working in all cases.
	  - Is it ever possible that somebody could
	    get score of over 999999? Check it out.
	  - Remove the field handling all out
	    from the tetris_t, create new
	    object type field_t, so that multiple
	    tetrises could refer to the same field.
	    First it would be useful in the main
	    intro screen, then in cooperative game.
	  - Start video_x.c sometime.
	  - Locate the video_fb.c from SOMEWHERE and
	    then backup it to at least five different
	    places. Then check, if it could be
	    optimized  for speed.
		
Mon 7.6.1999 18:30  Bisqwit <bisqwit@iki.fi>

	* Started work with beta5
	
	* Started work with the Linux
	  framebuffer system (video_fb.c).
	  - Supporting only 8-bit video modes.
	  - Selects the nearmost mode to 640x384.
	  - Cool antialias and transparency effects.
	  - All the features of video_term.c are now
	    working in video_fb.c also. Including the
	    timered blocks (Have you ever played the
	    Lemmings game? There's a button which makes
	    them to self-destruct, showing the number
	    on their head, indicating seconds left to
	    the *boom*. This means the similar :)).
	  
	* Added Noisy-flag to the bots.
	
	* Added Sim-bot.
	
	* Removed Demo mode, added tetris
	  intro (2*Dip) to the main logo
	  screen. (Disablable (misc.h).)
	  
	* Fixed video_term.c.
	  Now non-transparent blocks do not
	  overwrite transparent ones, and
	  it works better now.
	  Also, QField is no longer public,
	  and there are no *Color[] arrays.
	  
	* Added audio_ossmidi.c. It gets now never normally
	  automatically selected, but can be manually
	  enabled from config.h. Sounds quite funny on
	  my AWE32 card.
	* Started work with keybuffer system.
	  See Todo below. It does not work yet,
	  though. Disabled.
	  
	* Todo:
	  - Evil blocks and cheat blocks.
	  - Some keypresses may be lost sometimes.
	    Fix this by buffering the keystrokes
	    at the S_GAME state.
	  - TCP/IP game (dual player)
	  - High scores
	    . Think about the possibilities of
	      flock() and lockf() and fcntl().
	  - Make audio_esd.c working in all cases.
	  - Is it ever possible that somebody could
	    get score of over 999999? Seems very
	    unprobable to me. Check it out anyway.
	  - Remove the field handling all out
	    from the tetris_t, create new
	    object type field_t, so that multiple
	    tetrises could refer to the same field.
	    First it would be useful in the main
	    intro screen, then in cooperative game.
	  - Start video_x.c sometime.
	  - Check, if video_fb.c could be optimized
	    for speed.

Wed 2.6.1999 03:22  Bisqwit <bisqwit@iki.fi>

	* Started work with beta4
	
	* Added clock
	
	* Added multiple, selectionable
	  computer opponents, Dip, Zap,
	  Blip and Dak.
	  
	* Added configurable settings
	  for the bots.
	  See tetris.h for more.
	  
	* Added autoadjust for computer
	  players' speed.	 

	* Todo:
	  - Dreams. I should be tired now.
	  - More computer opponents and
	    more configurability.
	  - Evil blocks and cheat blocks.
	  - TCP/IP game (dual player)
	  - High scores
	    . Think about the possibilities of
	      flock() and lockf() and fcntl().
	  - Make video_fb.c working.
	  - Make audio_esd.c working in all cases.
	  
Tue 1.6.1999 02:15  Bisqwit <bisqwit@iki.fi>

	* Started work with beta3
	
	* Tested with SunOS
	 - Thanks to Warp (http://iki.fi/warp/)
	
	* Added computer opponent
	  - It is an excellent player. :)
	  - Todo:
	    . Notice the next block
	    . Now it either drops the blocks as soon
	      as it can, or just plays relaxed,
	      but there should be a midpoint too?
	   
	* Todo:
	  - Evil blocks and cheat blocks.
	  - Dreams. I should be tired now.
	  - TCP/IP game (dual player)
	  - High scores
	    . Think about the possibilities of
	      flock() and lockf() and fcntl().
	  - Make video_fb.c working.
	  - Make audio_esd.c working in all cases.

Sun 30.5.1999 02:14  Bisqwit <bisqwit@iki.fi>

	* ChangeLog, README, INSTALL, everything else
	  - beta2 revision
	 
	* Tested with Linux
	
	* Todo:
	  - TCP/IP game (multiplayer (two?))
	  - Computer opponent
	  - Synchronized sound output on
	    smaller sampling rates also
	    . is it possible?
	  - High scores
	    . how should it be done in multitasking
	      and multiuser environment?
