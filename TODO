| Tegazi 0: Normal tetris, competing against AI |
+-----------------------------------------------+

Thank you bisqwit for the motivation.

``` sidenote
I want to make something that resembles Wario's Wood game from the NES
It also must have a mode that is similar to Koopa Krunch from Mario Party Advance
```

>>> But now, I'm making a normal tetris game first, to explore the mechanics and
also implement Pierre Delacherie's algorithm

So, here are the TODOs:

- [ ]: Original tetris game (Tegazi 0)
  - [ ]: Tetris arena, with blocks collisons
  - [ ]: Combos, kicks, t-spins (will we support this in Tegazi++ ?)
  - [ ]: Rendering the arena
